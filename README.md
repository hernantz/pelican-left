# Left

Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com/), which means it was
battle-hardened from years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear
words. 

Although the original theme was targeted to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), 
I've tried to adapt it so that it can be used with Pelican.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in _config.yml. 
That's where we'll pull your name, Twitter username, and things like that.

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

* CNAME: If you're using this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: example.com).
* favicon.ico: This is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
* apple-touch-icon.png: Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps that use this file as an "icon" for your site.

## Licensing

This is [MIT](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/LICENSE) with no
added caveats, so feel free to use this on your site without linking back to
